Iâ€™ve wanted to escape from home.<br>
<br>
Ever since I was a teenager, I've been telling myself that "I gotta try my best." This 'try hard' logic was basically in order NOT to make my mom's life be transmitted to my life.<br> 
Her parent was very strict and when she moved out from her parents' place she met a guy, who is not my dad. Then I was made when they were only in two months relationship.<br>
Since then she seems to lament her life.<br>
<br>
"I will do everything for you, darling. My love, my daughter, I won't let your life be like mine."<br>
<br>
Ironically, however, I feel like I'm actually stepping in the same route as her life..Sadly enough, her love was often fettering me. Whenever I feel choked by the shackles, I can't help pitying my life.

<br>
Likewise, the fact that I'm the eldest girl has classically been a sufficient reason for my parents to reflect on themselves. It was not long ago that I realised those missions have been sitting quite heavy on my stomach. I'm aware that my stomach has been hugely filled with her pure love about me, but maybe some sub-love (some parts of her love) has been sadly a burden to me.
